## [Node learning project](https://github.com/Project-neuron/Node.js-project): 


### Project description
A learning project for node js. In this project I built a sample full stack website with a node backend. 
I used this as a learning opportunity to work on my backend server side skills. 
I used Visual studio for the IDE, Sequilize for the database interface with mySQL as the database.  
Express to handle the heavylifting for routing and serverside logic, ejs for the dynamic injection of data and manipulation of the HTML front end. CSS for styling.

## [New personal website V2]: 

### Project description
A personal website that I am building as a portfolio piece. 
When finished it will be a node backend inside of an containerized instance of docker. 
I hope to have it hosted on a cloud provider like AWS or digital ocean.

Currently working on building the html pages before I move on to the node backend.
